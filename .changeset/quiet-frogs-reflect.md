"@neo4j/graphql": patch
---

The `connectOrCreate` operation has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. Its implementation has always been more limited than the other operations, so the decision has been taken to remove it for the time being with a view of potentially refocussing on it again in the future.
