The `@id` directive has had a number of breaking changes.

The `autogenerate` argument has been removed. With this value set to `false`, the `@id` directive was essentially an alias for the `@unique` directive. Use the `@unique` directive instead.

The `unique` argument has been removed. We consider it necessary for a globally unique identifier to be backed by a unique node property constraint, so we have removed the ability to disable this. If you wish to automatically generate an ID without it being backed by a constraint, we recommend using the `@populatedBy` directive with a callback to generate appropriate values.

The `global` argument has been removed. This quite key feature of specifying the globally unique identifier for Relay was hidden away inside the `@id` directive. This functionality has been moved into its own directive, `@relayId`, which is used with no arguments. The use of the `@relayId` directive also implies that the field will be backed by a unique node property constraint.

Note, if using the `@id` and `@relayId` directive together on the same field, this will be an autogenerated ID compatible with Relay, and be backed by a single unique node property constraint. If you wish to give this constaint a name, use the `@unique` directive also with the `constraintName` argument.
