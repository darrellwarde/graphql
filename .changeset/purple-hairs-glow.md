The `@id` directive has had a number of breaking changes.

The `unique` argument has been removed. In an effort to simplify directives, `@id` will now only only be responsible for the autogeneration of UUID values.
If you would like the property to also be backed by a unique node property constraint, use the `@unique` directive alongside `@id`.

The `autogenerate` argument has been removed. With this value set to `false` and the above removal of constraint management, this would make the directive a no-op.

The `global` argument has been removed. This quite key feature of specifying the globally unique identifier for Relay was hidden away inside the `@id` directive. This functionality has been moved into its own directive, `@relayId`, which is used with no arguments. The use of the `@relayId` directive also implies that the field will be backed by a unique node property constraint.

Note, if using the `@id` and `@relayId` directive together on the same field, this will be an autogenerated ID compatible with Relay, and be backed by a single unique node property constraint. If you wish to give this constraint a name, use the `@unique` directive also with the `constraintName` argument.
