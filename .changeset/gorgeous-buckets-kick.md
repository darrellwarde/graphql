feat: Toolbox restructure after UX feedback

- Prompt to introspect type definitions on connection
- Restructuring of the page
   - Type definitions/query selector component moves to the top (forming a second "top bar")
   - Introspect button to be inside type definitions
   - Back to "Prettify" text in the button
   - Beta tag, use a blue label
   - Move the documentation sidebar to also be on the left, toggled by a slider in the Explorer
- Tweak the "Add new Query/Mutation" button in the Explorer
