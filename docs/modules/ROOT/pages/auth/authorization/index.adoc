WARNING: The `@auth` directive has been replaced by `@authentication` and `@authorization`. `@auth` will be removed in version 4.0.0. 
Please see the xref::guides/v4-migration/authorization.adoc[upgrade guide] for details on how to upgrade.

You specify authorization rules inside the `@auth` directive. This section looks at each option available and explains how to use it to implement authorization.
