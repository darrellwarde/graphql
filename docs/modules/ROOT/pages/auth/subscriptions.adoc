WARNING: The `@auth` directive has been replaced by `@authentication` and `@authorization`. `@auth` will be removed in version 4.0.0. 
Please see the xref::guides/v4-migration/authorization.adoc[upgrade guide] for details on how to upgrade.

xref::subscriptions/index.adoc[Subscriptions] can be used along with `@auth`, however, some operations are not supported. To setup rules,
use the `SUBSCRIBE` operation.

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String!
}

extend type Movie @auth(rules: [{ isAuthenticated: true, operations: [SUBSCRIBE] }])
```

== Authentication
If the authentication rules `isAuthenticated` and `allowUnauthenticated` are not met, the subscription request will fail and no events will
be sent.

== Roles
Roles can be set for subscriptions. Only requests matching the roles set will be accepted.

== Bind
